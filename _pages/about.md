Hello! Nice to meet you and welcome. I recently defended my PhD thesis which is funded by the [PARADIS](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/tristan.roussillon/paradis.html) research project at [LIRIS](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/) in Lyon, under the supervision of [David Coeurjolly](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/david.coeurjolly/) and [Tristan Roussillon](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/tristan.roussillon/). It is about developing variants and theoretical studies for plane probing algorithms  (2021-2023) 

A couple of things Iâ€™ve worked on: 
- Writing code for a program which fixes medical image recognition problems (2020)
- Solving partial differential equations for a pattern comparison problem  (2019)
- Creating mathematical models for soft robotic hands (2018)

Check out my [CV](https://mothorchids.github.io/cv/) for more details.
